		 "on the elevator perform a PUT command.  " +
		 "Upon inserting a token you should hear  " +
		 "a brief sound indicating success. Make  " +
		 "sure your avatar is inside the teleport " +
		 "and that your cursor is placed on the   " +
		 "teleporter itself. Now, type in '42nd'  " +
		 "or 'plaza' and press RETURN. Typing in  " +
		 "'home' will also take you to your       " +
