		"The TelePort was invented by the great  " +
		"tinkerer Avatar, Foontrafian Subtrax. It" +
		"took many years to perfect the technique" +
		"and many a test animal was lost to the  " +
		"void. It is still rumored to this day   " +
		"that, when the conditions are JUST right" +
		"a TelePorting Avatar may end up with    " +
		"animal parts in place of his normal     " +
		"limbs and/or head. Rest assured that    " +
		"this is ONLY a rumor. Regardless of the " +
		"rumored risks, the TelePort has become  " +
		"the single most valued addition to the  " +
		"universe, opening whole new realms for  " +
		"exploration. Socially the 'Port', as it " +
