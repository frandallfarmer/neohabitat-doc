		 "big problem in Habitat. There is only   " +
		 "one major gang, and it is now almost    " +
		 "extinct. If it has a name, none of its  " +
		 "members have ever spoken it publicly.   " +
		 "The only way they can identify each     " +
		 "other is by some secret hand signal. The" +
		 "Mob (as they are colloquially known) was" +
		 "formed by a small number of Avatars bent" +
		 "on self destruction. All but a few      " +
		 "members have been caught, (easily) tried" +
		 ", and sent into the void. Their crimes  " +
		 "are nearly always mis-handled or bungled",
		 
		 "in some major way. One good example of  " +
		 "their foolhardiness is reflected in     " +
		 "their security control: they have       " +
		 "consistently used only 2 style of locks " +
		 "& keys, styles #2000 and #4747. As is   " +
		 "widely known, these are the two most    " +
		 "common locks in the known world. You can" +
