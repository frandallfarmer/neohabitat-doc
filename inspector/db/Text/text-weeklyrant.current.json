		"Welcome to Habitat!  We're sure you're  " +
		"going to have a terrific time!  This is " +
		"the very first edition of the 'Weekly   " +
		"Rant', the Habitat newspaper.  The Rant " +
		"is your official source for the most    " +
		"up-to-date news and information about   " +
		"the Habitat world.  Here you will find  " +
		"the latest pronouncements from the      " +
		"Oracle, notices of important changes to " +
		"the world as they happen, and a timely  " +

		"Congratulations!  You're one of the     " +
		"Habitat pioneers.  When you get done    " +
		"wandering around your Turf, picking     " +
		"things up and putting them away again,  " +
		"changing the color of your furniture,   " +
		"fiddling with the lights, and generally " +
		"learning how things work, you're        " +
		"probably going to ask yourself, 'So,    " +
		"what do I do here?'                     " +
		"                                        " +
		"A good way to start getting yourself    " +
		"oriented is to learn how to use the     " +
		"TelePort network.  In order to TelePort " +
		"you'll need cash, so you'll have to find",

		"a Bank and learn to use the Automatic   " +
		"Token Machine.  To find a Bank you'll   " +
		"need to find the business district,     " +
		"which'll get you out exploring the      " +
		"world.  Be sure to take note of your    " +
		"street address the first time you step  " +
		"out front of your house -- you'll want  " +
		"to be able to find your way back!  Visit" +
		"the shops downtown.  Head on down to the" +
		"Oracle and see who's hanging out.  Be   " +
		"friendly!  And keep your eye out for    " +
		"clues.  Even though the world is just   " +
		"getting started, there's already a few  " +
		"adventures awaiting you!",

		"Today, the thieves in the now famous    " +
		"'Great Amulet Caper' were found guilty  " +
		"of Grand Theft Magic, and sentenced to 5" +
		"years in The Void.  In pronouncing the  " +
		"sentence to a hushed, packed courtroom, " +
		"Judge Themonioli was solemn.  'Zap'em   " +
		"'til they glow!' he said, 'let the      " +
		"Oracle sort'em out!  Next case!'        " +
		"                                        " +
		"The story began last week when the Great" +
		"Amulet of Wonderous Worth was stolen    " +
		"from the Back-Forty home of Habitat's   " +
		"resident Not-So-Wise-Man, Dada Salesh.",

		"Salesh, a powerful but clumsy wizard,   " +
		"tried to retrieve the valuable trinket  " +
		"with a homing-return spell, but his     " +
		"attempt backfired.  Instead of          " +
		"recovering the stolen property, Salesh  " +
		"accidentally Ported the thieves         " +
		"themselves to his house.  Although this " +
		"resulted in the thieves' immediate      " +
		"capture, the Amulet is still missing.   " +
		"                                        " +
		"All attempts by officials to extract    " +
		"information from the evil-doers have    " +
		"been in vain.  It is feared that the    " +
		"Amulet may remain forever lost.",
