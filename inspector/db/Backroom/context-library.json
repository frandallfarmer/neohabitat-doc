								+ "         EDITORIAL -- WELCOME!          "
								+ "Welcome to Habitat!  We're sure you're  "
								+ "going to have a terrific time!  This is "
								+ "the very first edition of the 'Weekly   "
								+ "Rant', the Habitat newspaper.  The Rant "
								+ "is your official source for the most    "
								+ "up-to-date news and information about   "
								+ "the Habitat world.  Here you will find  "
								+ "the latest pronouncements from the      "
								+ "Oracle, notices of important changes to "
								+ "the world as they happen, and a timely  "
								+ "accounting of the Avatars and events    "
								+ "that shape our lives.",

						"     THINGS TO DO IN HABITAT            "
								+ "                                        "
								+ "Congratulations!  You're one of the     "
								+ "Habitat pioneers.  When you get done    "
								+ "wandering around your Turf, picking     "
								+ "things up and putting them away again,  "
								+ "changing the color of your furniture,   "
								+ "fiddling with the lights, and generally "
								+ "learning how things work, you're        "
								+ "probably going to ask yourself, 'So,    "
								+ "what do I do here?'                     "
								+ "                                        "
								+ "A good way to start getting yourself    "
								+ "oriented is to learn how to use the     "
								+ "TelePort network.  In order to TelePort "
								+ "you'll need cash, so you'll have to find",

						"a Bank and learn to use the Automatic   "
								+ "Token Machine.  To find a Bank you'll   "
								+ "need to find the business district,     "
								+ "which'll get you out exploring the      "
								+ "world.  Be sure to take note of your    "
								+ "street address the first time you step  "
								+ "out front of your house -- you'll want  "
								+ "to be able to find your way back!  Visit"
								+ "the shops downtown.  Head on down to the"
								+ "Oracle and see who's hanging out.  Be   "
								+ "friendly!  And keep your eye out for    "
								+ "clues.  Even though the world is just   "
								+ "getting started, there's already a few  "
								+ "adventures awaiting you!",

								+ "Today, the thieves in the now famous    "
								+ "'Great Amulet Caper' were found guilty  "
								+ "of Grand Theft Magic, and sentenced to 5"
								+ "years in The Void.  In pronouncing the  "
								+ "sentence to a hushed, packed courtroom, "
								+ "Judge Themonioli was solemn.  'Zap'em   "
								+ "'til they glow!' he said, 'let the      "
								+ "Oracle sort'em out!  Next case!'        "
								+ "                                        "
								+ "The story began last week when the Great"
								+ "Amulet of Wonderous Worth was stolen    "
								+ "from the Back-Forty home of Habitat's   "
								+ "resident Not-So-Wise-Man, Dada Salesh.",

						"Salesh, a powerful but clumsy wizard,   "
								+ "tried to retrieve the valuable trinket  "
								+ "with a homing-return spell, but his     "
								+ "attempt backfired.  Instead of          "
								+ "recovering the stolen property, Salesh  "
								+ "accidentally Ported the thieves         "
								+ "themselves to his house.  Although this "
								+ "resulted in the thieves' immediate      "
								+ "capture, the Amulet is still missing.   "
								+ "                                        "
								+ "All attempts by officials to extract    "
								+ "information from the evil-doers have    "
								+ "been in vain.  It is feared that the    "
								+ "Amulet may remain forever lost.",
