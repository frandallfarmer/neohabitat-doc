<p style="margin-top: 1em" id="INTRO"><b>AN INTRODUCTION</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We
don&rsquo;t know all that much about Habitat, or Avatars,
the human-like inhabitants of that
world.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What we do
know is that Avatars share a rich social, intellectual and
cultural history that sets them apart from most higher life
forms. The detailing of their culture was made possible
through the work of Platorius and Figwash, two notable
Avatar anthropologists from Thelonius University. Professors
Platorius and Figwash graciously agreed to compile this
manual, assembling the information necessary to
&lsquo;&lsquo;introduce&rsquo;&rsquo; you to their society.
The rest, as they say, is up to
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We hope the
information provided herein will assist you as you explore
Habitat. We think you&rsquo;ll find, as we have, that
Avatars can be a lot like us...some of the
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" id="CHAP0"><b>SOME BACKGROUND</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Why You&rsquo;re
Here</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As Avatars,
we feel it necessary to explain to you why we, in essence,
are allowing you to take our form and enter our
society.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The early
Avatars were adventurers like none other. If you read
through Habitat history, you will find stories of grand
expeditions, the discovery of magnificent treasures, and
tales of bravery and valor that would challenge those of
your King Arthur with his Knights of the Round
Table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But, as the
years passed, Avatars changed. The spirit of adventuring
died away, and we became more and more content to do
nothing...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You see,
the Avatars, when left to themselves, have become basically
lazy creatures that would be only too happy to sit or sleep
all day and night, lounging in their hot tubs, reading
magazines or books, or chatting with friends, but never
getting out to see the world because it would take too much
effort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Oracle,
which both watches over and directs life in Habitat (you
will read more about It later), eventually became quite
bored with this state of affairs and decided to take some
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As Mystical
Beings sometimes will, the Oracle decided that a Drastic
Measure was in order, and allowed the discovery of our world
by yours. The result, It hoped, would be for things, as you
humans say, &lsquo;&lsquo;to start
hopping&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once over
the shock of intrusion, we Avatars came to agree with the
Oracle. Our long period of inactivity has made most of us
eager for some adventure, some intrigue, and some
exercise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other
words, we&rsquo;re game if you
are...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><p style="margin-top: 1em" id="CHAP1"><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big><big>GETTING THERE</big></big></b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><big><i>A Basic Introduction to
Habitat</i></big></p></center>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getting to Habitat is
accomplished by choosing &lsquo;&lsquo;Lucasfilm&rsquo;s
Habitat&rsquo;&rsquo; from the games menu in
QuantumLink&rsquo;s <b>People Connection</b> department. If
&lsquo;&lsquo;Lucasfilm&rsquo;s Habitat&rsquo;&rsquo; is not
on your games menu, please see the installation instructions
that accompanied your Habitat disk. To enter Habitat, you
will need the QuantumLink Program Disk and the
Lucasfilm&rsquo;s Habitat Disk. Presumably you already have
these things, or why would you be reading this? When you
choose Habitat from the games menu, you will be asked to
insert your Habitat Program Disk (side 1 of the
Lucasfilm&rsquo;s Habitat Disk) in the disk drive, from
which the Habitat program will be loaded into your computer.
It will then ask you to put your Habitat Imagery Disk (side
2 of the Lucasfilm&rsquo;s Habitat Disk) in the disk drive
when it is ready for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Naturally, you need to
have your disk drive, monitor and modem hooked up and your
joystick plugged into Joystick Port #1. All other
peripherals must be unplugged. And you better
unplug&rsquo;em too, otherwise it won&rsquo;t
work!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you enter Habitat
for the first time, you will be given a chance to customize
the appearance of your Avatar. Customization is explained in
more detail below. Once you have done this, you will see
your Avatar waiting for you in your
&lsquo;&lsquo;Turf&rsquo;&rsquo;, or home. Go for a
&lsquo;&lsquo;test drive&rsquo;&rsquo; by trying out some or
all of the basic commands, which follow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Basic Habitat
Commands</big></b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avatars understand and
respond to six basic commands: <b>GO</b>, <b>DO</b>,
<b>GET</b>, <b>PUT</b>, <b>TALK</b> and
<b>HELP</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Using the
Joystick</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To initiate any of the
basic commands (except <b>TALK</b> and <b>HELP</b>), you
must press the button on your joystick, at which time the
cursor will change into a question mark icon. Move the
joystick forward, backward, left or right to the command you
wish to give. The cursor will again change, into an icon
showing the command you have chosen. Release the button to
select this command. Your Avatar will then undertake the
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you accidentally get
the wrong command icon by pushing the joystick in the wrong
direction, don&rsquo;t worry. You can select another command
by just moving the joystick to another position. Your Avatar
won&rsquo;t do anything until you release the button. If you
didn&rsquo;t mean to push the button at all, just release
the button while the question mark icon is showing. The four
command icons will all change back into the question mark
icon if you release the joystick and wait a few moments
without doing anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>The</i> <b>GO</b>
<i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command directs your
Avatar in motion. If you wish to go somewhere, point the
cursor to the spot or thing you wish to go to, and press the
joystick button. Then move the stick to the <b>GO</b>
position (the <b>GO</b> command icon will appear on the
screen), and release the button. Your Avatar will walk to
the spot indicated (pointing to the very edge of the screen
will take you to the region next door &mdash; see page 21
for more information). In this way you can cross a room,
explore the countryside, or just take a leisurely stroll. Be
careful where you direct your Avatar to walk: if he
encounters an obstacle in his path, he will stop when he
bumps into it!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Samantha appeared at
the door, and Winona crossed the room to greet her.
&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey, Win!&rsquo;&rsquo; Samantha shouted,
&lsquo;&lsquo;I just got a message from Smedley. A gang is
getting together over at his Turf for a little
soak.&rsquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;&lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll pass on
that one,&rsquo;&rsquo; Winona blushed. &lsquo;&lsquo;After
that last party I swore I&rsquo;d never get near
Smedley&rsquo;s hot tub again.&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>The</i> <b>GET</b>
<i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Habitat is littered with
objects, some of which you will need or want. To <b>GET</b>
one of them, point the cursor at it, press the button,
select the <b>GET</b> command, and release the button. Your
Avatar will walk to the object, bend over and pick it
up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to remember that
you can only hold one object in your hand at one time
&mdash; that&rsquo;s why Avatars have pockets. You should
also know that you cannot <b>GET</b> some objects, such as
trees and houses, because they are either too heavy or they
are fastened down. If you try to <b>GET</b> something and
fail, either because your Avatar&rsquo;s hands are already
full or because the object just isn&rsquo;t <b>GET</b>able,
you will simply hear a &lsquo;&lsquo;BEEP&rsquo;&rsquo; and
nothing will happen on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Norbert snickered with
Broderick, as the two watched the new Avatar on the block
trying out the</i> <b>GET</b> <i>command. &lsquo;&lsquo;You
can always tell a greenhorn,&rsquo;&rsquo; Norbert chuckled.
&lsquo;&lsquo;They have no concept of the laws of physics
&mdash; I just saw this guy try to pick up the TelePort
booth!&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>The</i> <b>PUT</b>
<i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously, the opposite of
<b>GET</b>. To use <b>PUT</b>, point to the place you wish
to put an object in your possession, press the button,
choose <b>PUT</b> and release the button. Your Avatar will
drop the object at the indicated spot, crossing the room if
need be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Cynthia and Ralphie were
having a teensie-weensie little disagreement about how she
should arrange her Turf. &lsquo;&lsquo;I mean it,
Cyn,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ralphie insisted, &lsquo;&lsquo;you gotta
put the lamp on the left side of the room and the trophy on
the shelf!&rsquo;&rsquo; Cynthia smiled sweetly.
&lsquo;&lsquo;Do you know where you can put the lamp,
Ralphie?&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>The</i> <b>DO</b>
<i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This
&lsquo;&lsquo;catch-all&rsquo;&rsquo; command directs your
Avatar to take some kind of action, either <i>with</i> an
object, or <i>to</i> an object. The action taken depends on
what object you are pointing at and what, if anything, your
Avatar is holding in his hands. Press the button and select
<b>DO</b>, then release the button. The object you point to
will make the appropriate response. For example, the door
will open or close, or the lamp will turn on or off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Gee, look what
I found!&rsquo;&rsquo; Sedgewick said.
&lsquo;&lsquo;Sedge,&rsquo;&rsquo; stammered Noah,
&lsquo;&lsquo;where did you get
that...that...gun?&rsquo;&rsquo;
&lsquo;&lsquo;Golly,&rsquo;&rsquo; Sedgewick smiled evilly,
&lsquo;&lsquo;what do you think would happen if I pointed
this at you and hit the</i> <b>DO</b>
<i>command?&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>The</i> <b>TALK</b>
<i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command doesn&rsquo;t
involve using the joystick button. To <b>TALK</b> to other
Avatars, simply type your message on the keyboard, and press
the <b>RETURN</b> key when finished. Everyone you see on the
screen will receive your message in a &lsquo;&lsquo;word
balloon&rsquo;&rsquo; displayed above your Avatar&rsquo;s
head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also talk directly to
certain special objects, like an Oracle&rsquo;s Fountain or
a TelePort booth. Just point the cursor to the object (the
Fountain or the booth), and type the message on the
keyboard. Again, press <b>RETURN</b> when finished. If you
are in a place with one of these objects, be careful where
you point the cursor &mdash; if what you really mean to do
is speak to the other Avatars on the screen, you should make
sure you are not pointing at, say, a TelePort booth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a special form of
<b>TALK</b> called <i>ESP</i> that lets you send private
messages to Avatars who may be elsewhere in the world. ESP
is described on page 18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Talk to me
baby,&rsquo;&rsquo; the Avastud leered at the innocent young
girl. &lsquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your sign? Come here often?
What&rsquo;s a nice Avatar like you doing in a place like
this? Didn&rsquo;t we know each other in another life? How
am I doing?&rsquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it past
your bedtime?&rsquo;&rsquo; she coolly asked, and walked
away. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think she really likes
me,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said to no one in particular, taking
chase.</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>The</i> <b>HELP</b>
<i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the items in Habitat
have helpful instruction plates attached to them by their
manufacturers. You can read an object&rsquo;s instruction
plate by pointing at the object with the cursor and then
pressing the <b>HELP</b> (<b>F7</b>) key. This can be handy
if you forget how something works or if you encounter an
object you have never seen before. Practically everything in
Habitat has a label or instruction plate of some sort on it.
Be forewarned, however, that some items&rsquo; instructions
may be more mysterious than helpful. This is especially true
of things that are magical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also find out who
another Avatar is by pointing at him and then pressing the
<b>HELP</b> (<b>F7</b>) key. A word balloon with his name in
it will appear over his head. However, it is considered
somewhat snoopy to do this to someone; to guard against
invasions of privacy, whenever you identify someone with the
<b>HELP</b> key, the Oracle automatically displays for the
other person a balloon over <i>your</i> head telling
<i>them</i> who <i>you</i> are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big><big>How Certain Things
Work</big></big></b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Ghosts</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avatars can turn themselves into
&lsquo;&lsquo;ghosts&rsquo;&rsquo;. When an Avatar is a
ghost, he can&rsquo;t affect the world in any way, though he
can move around and see what is happening wherever he may
be. Ghosts are an exception to the so-called
&lsquo;&lsquo;five guests only&rsquo;&rsquo; rule, which
states that no more than six Avatars may gather in one place
at a time (see Chapter Three &mdash; Getting Around). Any
number of ghosts (well, a very large number anyway) can
occupy the same place at the same time. Turning yourself
into a ghost is the preferred way of bypassing traffic jams
in crowded areas. Becoming a ghost is also the way you join
the audience in a theater or night club.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To turn your Avatar into a
ghost, press the <b>F1</b> key. Your Avatar&rsquo;s body
will disappear. To turn back into an Avatar, simply press
<b>F1</b> again. Your body will be restored to its previous
condition. If you are a ghost, or if there are any ghosts in
a region with you, you will see the
&lsquo;&lsquo;ghost-icon&rsquo;&rsquo;, an Egyptian
Eye-Of-Horus hieroglyph, displayed in the upper left-hand
corner of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To attend a play or lecture or
other mass entertainment, turn yourself into a ghost before
entering the theater. To get through an over-crowded section
of the world, turn yourself into a ghost and move about as
if the crowd wasn&rsquo;t there. When you reach an uncrowded
place, you can turn yourself back into a regular Avatar. You
won&rsquo;t be able to turn back into an Avatar if it is too
crowded when you try to do so (you will simply hear a soft
&lsquo;&lsquo;BOING&rsquo;&rsquo; sound instead). You will
just have to move to a less crowded place or wait for
somebody else to leave.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Matters of Posture</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are certain body movements
you can control, such as standing up and sitting down. Point
the cursor at your Avatar and press the button. Choose
<b>GO</b> and watch him cycle his body posture among the
available positions. You can also make gestures by pressing
the &lsquo;&lsquo;gesture keys&rsquo;&rsquo;. These are the
<b>CTRL-</b><i>digit</i> keys (hold the <b>CTRL</b> key down
while pressing one of the digits <b>0</b> through
<b>9</b>).</p></br>

<center><table width=75%>
    <tr><td width=50%><i>Pressing</i></td><td><i>makes your avatar</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-1</td><td>wave his hand</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-2</td><td>point</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-3</td><td>hold out his hands</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-4</td><td>jump in the air </td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-5</td><td>face forward</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-6</td><td>face backward</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-7</td><td>bend over</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-8</td><td>stand up again</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-9</td><td>make a punching motion</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>CTRL</b>-0</td><td>frown</td></tr>
</table></center>

</br><p>In addition, <b>F6</b> changes the color of flesh tones.
You can make Avatars look white or green or any other color,
if you are uncomfortable with the conventional pink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Doors</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you <b>GO</b> to a door, your
Avatar will generally just walk to the door. However, if the
door is open and you point at the opening, your Avatar will
walk <i>through</i> the door and go to whatever place is on
the other side of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can open or close a door it
by pointing at it and choosing the <b>DO</b> command. If
your Avatar is not standing next to it when you do this,
your he will walk to the door first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Seats</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you <b>GO</b> to a seat of
some sort, such as a chair or a couch, your Avatar will
generally just walk to it. However, if he is already next to
it, he will sit down in it. He can stand up again with
another <b>GO</b> command. If your Avatar is seated, the
only commands you can use are <b>TALK</b> and <b>GO</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Containers</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some objects, like suitcases and
boxes, are containers that can hold other objects. To put
something in a container, point at the container and select
<b>PUT</b>. A container will only hold a certain number of
objects, depending on its size. If it has reached its limit
you will hear a &lsquo;&lsquo;BEEP&rsquo;&rsquo; sound and
you will not be able to add anything more without first
removing something from it using <b>GET</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some containers, such as boxes
and bags, may be opened and closed. You can pick up a closed
container, but not an open one. Of course, you can&rsquo;t
<b>PUT</b> anything into a closed container or take anything
out. To open or close a container, point at it and choose
<b>DO</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To <b>GET</b> an object from an
open container, point at the container, press the button,
and choose <b>GET</b>. A picture will appear on your screen,
showing you each of the objects in the container. Point at
the one you want with the cursor and press the button to
indicate your choice. If you don&rsquo;t want any of the
objects after all, point the cursor to empty space and press
the button. In either case, once a choice has been made, the
picture will disappear. (In some cases, the Commodore 64
will not have enough memory to display all the objects. If
this happens, it will show you as many as it can; then, if
you do not choose any of these, it will show you some more,
continuing in this fashion until you have had an opportunity
to see every object in the container). If you selected an
object, you will <b>GET</b> it out of the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Now, have I got
everything for my adventure?&rsquo;&rsquo; Rodney mused as
he packed his suitcase. &lsquo;&lsquo;Boomerang, check.
Compass, check. Grenade, check. Magic staff, check. And a
change of disguise. Good &mdash; enough room left for the
Orb of Oshtemo...if and when I find
it...&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Pockets</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every Avatar has a pocket to
carry things. You can put something your Avatar is carrying
into his pocket by pointing at the Avatar himself and
choosing <b>PUT</b>, and you can get things back out again
by pointing at the Avatar and choosing <b>GET</b>. Pockets
work just like any other container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Locks and Keys</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some things you will
be able to lock, such as certain containers and doors. To
unlock or lock these objects, you must be holding the key
when you select the <b>DO</b> function to open or close
them. If a door or container is locked and you do not have
the key, you simply will be unable to open it and
you&rsquo;ll hear a &lsquo;&lsquo;BEEP&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys all look pretty much alike,
but they are not all the same. Each key goes with a
particular lock. Keys are distinguished by their
&lsquo;&lsquo;key numbers&rsquo;&rsquo;. To identify a key,
point at it and press <b>HELP</b> (<b>F7</b>). The key
number will be shown in a word balloon. In addition,
containers and doors with locks on them will display their
required key numbers in their <b>HELP</b> messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Reading and Writing</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to read something,
such as a book or a newspaper, you must first <b>GET</b> it.
Then, point at it and select <b>DO</b>. The text will appear
on the screen. At the bottom of the screen will be a series
of &lsquo;&lsquo;buttons&rsquo;&rsquo;. You can press one of
these screen buttons by pointing at it with the cursor and
pressing the joystick button. When you are finished reading,
pressing the <b>QUIT</b> button will end the text display.
If the thing you are reading has more than one page, you can
flip the pages back and forth by pressing the <b>NEXT</b> or
<b>BACK</b> buttons. You can also flip to any page you care
to by pressing the <b>PAGE</b> button and then typing in the
desired page number when prompted to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are holding a piece of
paper, you can write on it in addition to reading it. Point
at the paper and select <b>DO</b>. Again, the text will
appear on the screen. If it is a fresh piece of paper, the
screen will be blank. You &lsquo;&lsquo;write&rsquo;&rsquo;
by typing on the keyboard. You can control where on the page
you are writing by moving the cursor around with the
joystick. You can erase text with the <b>DEL</b> key. You
can erase the entire page by pressing the <b>ERASE</b>
button. When you are finished writing, press the <b>QUIT</b>
button as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Mail</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every Avatar can send mail to
other Avatars and receive mail from them. To send mail to
someone, just write your letter on a blank piece of paper.
On the first line of the letter, write
&lsquo;&lsquo;To:&rsquo;&rsquo; and then the name of the
Avatar to whom you want it sent &mdash; obviously, the
Habitat Post Office can&rsquo;t deliver a letter unless you
provide an address. When you are finished composing your
letter, just press the <b>MAIL IT</b> button at the bottom
of the screen instead of pressing <b>QUIT</b>. You message
will be sent on its way automagically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mail is delivered to your
Avatar&rsquo;s pocket. If there are mail messages awaiting
you, when you <b>GET</b> from your pocket you will see a
letter envelope among the things you are carrying. Pointing
at this and pressing the button will <b>GET</b> the first
letter (written on a piece of paper) into your
Avatar&rsquo;s hands. You can read this letter by pointing
to it and choosing <b>DO</b>, as explained above in the
description of paper. The top line of the letter will give
the name of the sender and a postmark. If there is more than
one letter waiting for you, you can <b>GET</b> each one from
your pocket in turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have received a piece of
mail from someone, the <b>REPLY</b> button is a useful
shortcut that you can use to compose a response. Pressing
the <b>REPLY</b> button will turn the postmark into the
appropriate &lsquo;&lsquo;To: so-and-so&rsquo;&rsquo; line
and erase the rest of the page so you can write your message
on it. Just write your message and <b>MAIL IT</b> as if you
had started from a blank sheet of paper. Since <b>REPLY</b>
does erase the page, you won&rsquo;t want to use it when you
want to save the message that you are replying to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no mail waiting,
instead of the envelope you will see a blank sheet of paper
in your pocket. <b>GET</b>ing this will yield a fresh, blank
sheet of paper that you may use to send mail or to write
notes to yourself or others. You can get as many blank
sheets in this fashion as you like &mdash; it&rsquo;s an
unlimited supply. However, to prevent littering, any
<i>blank</i> piece of paper that leaves your Avatar&rsquo;s
hands will simply disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;To: Chuckoober
&lsquo;&lsquo;My dearest Chuckles,&rsquo;&rsquo; wrote
Daphne, &lsquo;&lsquo;You are the Avatar of my eye. Oh,
Chucklette, when will I see you again?&rsquo;&rsquo; She
signed her name amid countless X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s and
sent it on its way. When Chuck got the letter, he tossed his
cookies.</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>ESP</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avatars have a certain
telepathic ability and can communicate with each other over
vast distances using ESP. ESP is a special private form of
<b>TALK</b>. To <b>TALK</b> via ESP to someone, type
&lsquo;&lsquo;To:&rsquo;&rsquo;, and then the name of the
person you want to send to, and then press <b>RETURN</b>. A
prompt will appear at the top of the screen:
&lsquo;&lsquo;<b>ESP:</b>&rsquo;&rsquo;. (If you try to send
ESP to someone who does not exist, or who is not in Habitat
at the time, you will be told that the person cannot be
contacted and you will not receive the ESP prompt.) When you
see this prompt, type the message you want to send, as many
lines as you wish, ending each with a <b>RETURN</b>. Press
<b>RETURN</b> directly at the ESP prompt &mdash; i.e., enter
a blank line &mdash; to stop sending ESP (this is to tell
the stupid computer that you are done). You must end one ESP
message before you can send another one. For example, if you
wanted to send an ESP message to the Avatar named Gerfingle,
you would type &lsquo;&lsquo;To:
Gerfingle<i>(RETURN)</i>&rsquo;&rsquo; and then your
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to find out who is
inside Habitat right now so that you can send ESP to them,
pressing the <b>F3</b> key will give you a list of the last
few Avatars who have entered the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If someone sends an ESP message
to you, a word balloon will appear over your Avatar&rsquo;s
head, saying &lsquo;&lsquo;ESP from so-and-so&rsquo;&rsquo;
and then the message they are sending you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Leaving Habitat</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To leave Habitat, just press the
<b>SHIFT</b> and <b>RUN-STOP</b> keys at the same time. You
will be returned to <b>People Connection</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever you leave Habitat,
either deliberately or by accident (e.g., if there is a
problem with your telephone or a power failure), your Avatar
is automatically turned into a ghost. This is the
Oracle&rsquo;s way of protecting your inanimate body from
roaming brigands while at the same time preventing it from
obstructing traffic. When you log back in you may need to
press the <b>F1</b> key to cease being a ghost.</p>

<center><p style="margin-top: 1em" id="CHAP2"><b>CHAPTER TWO</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big><big>THE FASHIONABLE
AVATAR</big></big></b></p></center>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><blockquote><i><small>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh,
brother,&rsquo;&rsquo; Wilhelmina whispered to Prunella,
&lsquo;&lsquo;here comes ole fashion plate
again.&rsquo;&rsquo; Prunella looked over to see
devastatingly handsome Berford sauntering up in the latest
Oscy De La Rooster style. &lsquo;&lsquo;Who does he think he
is?&rsquo;&rsquo; Wilhelmina hissed.</br> &lsquo;&lsquo;The
Oracle&rsquo;s gift to Avatars,&rsquo;&rsquo; Prunella
sighed, stars in her eyes. &lsquo;&lsquo;The Oracle&rsquo;s
gift to Avatars.&rsquo;&rsquo;</small></i></p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the really fun
things you can do when you enter Habitat is customize your
appearance. What you get to help you in this task is a
customization program allowing you to make the kind of
alterations that would make a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon
cry. You&rsquo;ll automatically be put into the
customization program the first time you enter Habitat. Just
follow the instructions it gives you and you&rsquo;ll do
fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clothing works a
little differently. Avatars never go around undressed. In
fact, their clothes are part of their bodies. It&rsquo;s
easy to change your Avatar&rsquo;s appearance though...just
use a handy bottle of spray-on body color. These can be
purchased down at the General Store, or you can borrow one
from a friend. While you are holding a sprayer, you can
change the coloration of different parts of your body by
pointing at them with the cursor and choosing
the <b>DO</b> command.</p>

<center><img src="images/spray.png"></img></center>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also change
your Avatar&rsquo;s head. New heads can be gotten at a Head
Shop, though they are often quite expensive &mdash; and the
more exotic a head is, the more it will cost you. You can
remove your Avatar&rsquo;s old head simply by
<b>GET</b>ing it into your hands &mdash; just point at
the head and choose <b>GET</b>. Then <b>PUT</b>
your old head down somewhere and <b>GET</b> the
new one. Once you are holding the new head in your hands,
you can <b>PUT</b> it on your shoulders by pointing
at yourself and choosing <b>PUT</b>.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although you can
remove your head at any time, it is considered extremely
tacky to wander around the world headless. The sight of a
headless Avatar can be quite upsetting to some of the
younger, more liberal citizens of Habitat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some common styles of
appearance in Habitat appear below:</p>

<hr>

<center><p style="margin-top: 1em" id="CHAP3"><b>CHAPTER THREE</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big><big>GETTING
AROUND</big></big></b></p></center>

<blockquote><p style="margin-top: 1em"><i><small>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh,
Ruark,&rsquo;&rsquo; Penelope breathed, &lsquo;&lsquo;I love
you as no Avatar has ever loved another. But I fear for your
life when my despised betrothed, Horace Mugwart, learns of
our passion!&rsquo;&rsquo;</br></br>  Ruark stared at her with
intensely blue eyes set under his perfectly molded brow.</br></br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;Penelope, my dove,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said with
all the gentleness and strength she had come to love him
for, &lsquo;&lsquo;when will you learn that I can take care
of you? Freedom is just a TelePort away.&rsquo;&rsquo;</br></br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh, Ruark,&rsquo;&rsquo; Penelope cried,
&lsquo;&lsquo;How foolish I was not to trust you!
We&rsquo;ll simply TelePort so far away he&rsquo;ll never
find us!&rsquo;&rsquo;</small></i></p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The world of Habitat
is quite large, and growing larger all the time. Since
Avatars love exploration and adventure, being a seasoned
world traveller is considered the surest sign of class and
character. The ultimate status symbol in Avatar high society
is to be able to give accurate directions to such exciting
and obscure spots as the Great Enchanted Art Deco Caves and
the infamous
Tavern-Deep-In-The-Heart-Of-The-Terribly-Confusing-Desert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What you see on the
screen at any given time is just one small part of the
world. Each such place is called a
&lsquo;&lsquo;region&rsquo;&rsquo;. One of the ways you can
get from one region to the next is by walking. Just point
the cursor off the edge of the screen to the right or the
left or the bottom, or above the horizon into the sky in
back, and then select <b>GO</b>. Your
Avatar will walk in the chosen direction, out of the region
and into the one next door. The screen will black-out during
the time it takes to go between regions, and some
&lsquo;&lsquo;snappy tunes to travel by&rsquo;&rsquo; will
kick in (you can make the tunes stop with the <b>F2</b>
key). You can also travel to other regions by <b>GO</b>ing
through a doorway or to a building in the
distance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not every region has
neighbors in all four directions. If there is nothing next
door, when you try to <b>GO</b> off the edge of the screen
your Avatar will simply walk as far as he can and
&lsquo;&lsquo;BEEP&rsquo;&rsquo; at you, and a warning
message will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>The &lsquo;&lsquo;Five
Guests Only&rsquo;&rsquo; Rule and The Stuff
Limit</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ever since the
&lsquo;&lsquo;War to End All Wars, I Think&rsquo;&rsquo; the
Oracle won&rsquo;t allow gatherings of more than six Avatars
in one place at one time. This is the basis of the so-called
&lsquo;&lsquo;five guests only&rsquo;&rsquo; rule. If you
try to walk or TelePort to a place that is already filled to
capacity, the Oracle won&rsquo;t admit you. Instead, you
will hear a &lsquo;&lsquo;BOING&rsquo;&rsquo; sound and be
left standing where you already were. Of course, you can
always turn into a ghost to get into or through congested
regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fact is, the Oracle just
doesn&rsquo;t like the world to get too cluttered. It
won&rsquo;t let you get more than a certain amount of stuff
in one place at a time. If you try to do something that will
exceed the Stuff Limit, you just won&rsquo;t be allowed to
succeed. This most commonly occurs when you try to walk into
another region carrying more things than the Oracle deems
will fit, but it can also happen when you try to open a
closed container, buy something from a VenDroid, or do
anything else that introduces a new item into the world. As
when you try to violate the &lsquo;&lsquo;five guests
only&rsquo;&rsquo; rule, you will hear a soft
&lsquo;&lsquo;BOING&rsquo;&rsquo; sound to let you know what
is going on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are stuck, unable
to do something because of the Stuff Limit, try putting
things in your pocket, closing containers or discarding
things in a garbage can.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><small><i>TelePorts</i></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a long way to
go, walking the whole way can be rather dull. This is why
the Oracle created TelePorts. A TelePort is like a
telephone, except that it sends your Avatar instead of your
voice. TelePort booths are scattered throughout Habitat,
though they are much more common in the urban areas. The
TelePort is the preferred mode of long-distance
transportation in Habitat, being a great improvement over
walking, flying, or taking a bus or a taxi. This is
especially true since there are no airplanes, busses or
taxis in Habitat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use a TelePort booth,
first walk into the booth by pointing at it and choosing
<b>GO</b>. Then <b>PUT</b> some money into it (point at the
booth and choose <b>PUT</b> while your Avatar is holding a
Token &mdash; Tokens are described in more detail in Chapter
Nine). If you have enough money, the TelePort will turn
itself on and indicate that it is activated by flashing its
logo (the costs vary somewhat, depending on how far you are
going).</p></br>

<center><img src="images/port.png"></img></center>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the booth is
activated, you can Port wherever you want by <b>TALK</b>ing
to the booth: point the cursor at the booth and type the
TelePort address of your destination. Be sure your cursor is
pointing at the booth! If the address you type doesn&rsquo;t
match any destination, or if you just don&rsquo;t have
enough money in hand to travel the distance, you won&rsquo;t
go anywhere. Try a different address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TelePort addresses are
like telephone numbers, except that they can have letters in
them too. TelePort addresses are usually names that identify
the places they are located. You can find out the TelePort
addresses of places you might want to visit by looking at a
TelePort Directory. These handy books can be found in any
Habitat Public Library. You can also find out the TelePort
address of a Port you&rsquo;re at by pointing at it with the
cursor and pressing the <b>HELP</b> (<b>F7</b>)
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like telephone numbers,
TelePort addresses have area codes. To Port outside the area
you are in (a &lsquo;&lsquo;long distance
Port&rsquo;&rsquo;), you must give an area code. If the
place you are Porting to is inside your area (a
&lsquo;&lsquo;local Port&rsquo;&rsquo;), you don&rsquo;t
need to give an area code, though you can if you feel like
it. For example, the area code for the town of Populopolis
is &lsquo;&lsquo;<b>Pop</b>&rsquo;&rsquo;. Let&rsquo;s say
you want to Port to the booth at the north end of Bleem
Street in Populopolis. If you are already within the
Populopolis area, the TelePort address is
&lsquo;&lsquo;<b>Bleem St North</b>&rsquo;&rsquo; but from
outside the area you would have to use
&lsquo;&lsquo;<b>Pop-Bleem St North</b>&rsquo;&rsquo;. Got
it?</p>

<center><p style="margin-top: 1em" id="CHAP4"><b>CHAPTER FOUR</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big><big>TURF, SWEET
TURF</big></big></b></p></center>

<blockquote><p style="margin-top: 1em"><i><small>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh,
heck,&rsquo;&rsquo; MacGruder thought, &lsquo;&lsquo;if
Chrysanthe and Penelope are coming for tea, I suppose I
really should spruce the place up.&rsquo;&rsquo; He quickly
straightened up his Turf, and gazing around, grew more and
more dissatisfied with the looks of the place.
&lsquo;&lsquo;I know!&rsquo;&rsquo; he exclaimed, snapping
his fingers, &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
redecorate!&rsquo;&rsquo;</small></i></p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decorating, or, as in
MacGruder&rsquo;s case, redecorating, is accomplished in a
couple of different ways. You can get a device called a
&lsquo;&lsquo;Change-O-Matic&rsquo;&rsquo; that will let you
choose the color and pattern of the things in your Turf. To
use it, hold it in your hands, point at the item you wish to
change, and choose <b>DO</b>. The thing you have pointed at
will change. By doing this several times in a row you can
cycle through all the various choices of color and style. As
with the body-sprayer, the Change-O-Matic can be purchased
at the General Store or you can borrow somebody
else&rsquo;s. Unless you have been chosen by the Oracle as a
highly trustworthy person of impeccable taste, a
Change-O-Matic will only work for you inside your own
Turf.</p>

<center><img src="images/chango.png"></img></center>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your Turf will come with
some furniture, leaving it up to you to make just the right
touches in decor. Maybe you&rsquo;ll find them in the form
of artifacts you bring back from your adventures. Perhaps
you&rsquo;ll have to go out and buy them. The Stuff Limit
applies in the home Turf as well as anywhere else &mdash;
don&rsquo;t be extravagant, and don&rsquo;t try to crowd too
many objects into one area. No one will be impressed, and it
will limit the number of people you can
entertain.</p>

<center><p style="margin-top: 1em" id="CHAP5"><b>CHAPTER FIVE</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big><big>THE ORACLE
FACTOR</big></big></b></p></center>

<blockquote><p style="margin-top: 1em"><i><small>&lsquo;&lsquo;Tell me,
oh Wise One,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Platypus to the Oracle,
&lsquo;&lsquo;will there be even greater adventure and
riches in my future?&rsquo;&rsquo; The answer from the
Oracle was as foreboding as it was
mysterious.</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i><small>&lsquo;&lsquo;Your
greed is such <br>
That you may find <br>
All you dare to seek. <br>
In far off lands <br>
With seven seas <br>
And one, gigantic peak, <br>
You&rsquo;ll find the riches <br>
But Beware <br>
The ghastly Fendersneek.&rsquo;&rsquo;</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i><small>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh,
thank you, Oracle!&rsquo;&rsquo; Platypus cried, and ran
home to prepare for the adventure, little realizing that it
would be his last.</small></i></p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one pervasive
factor in every Avatar&rsquo;s life: the Oracle, the great,
all-knowing, mysterious power residing in Habitat. No one
knows where It came from &mdash; but then again, no one
really cares.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What Avatars do care
about is the fun, intrigue and adventure that the Oracle
provides. In return, they support It with
donations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Oracle grants
wishes, sends Avatars on quests and adventures, and has been
known to play a trick or two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Oracle takes on
many forms and appears in many places. It commonly manifests
Itself as the fountain found in the center of most Habitat
towns. However, there are other places where it appears, and
they are not all the same. In particular, the Oracle likes
to encourage travel and exploration by making you journey to
exotic and distant places before It will answer some
questions or grant certain requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can speak with the
Oracle by <b>TALK</b>ing to one of its
manifestations, such as the fountain. Simply point at the
Oracle and type your question or request. Sometimes the
Oracle will talk back to you, or even carry on a
conversation. Usually, however, it will respond later by
mail, if at all. For above all else, the Oracle is as
unpredictable as It is mysterious, and should never, never
be taken for granted.</p></br>

<center><img src="images/fount.png"></img></center>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the more mundane
manifestations of the Oracle is its administrative minion,
the <i>Bureaucrat-In-A-Box</i>. Bureaucrats-In-A-Box are
usually found in the City Hall building downtown. These
dedicated souls form the executive branch of Habitat. Each
Bureaucrat is dedicated to a particular task, such as
handling transfers of Turf ownership, allocating commercial
space to Avatars, controlling advertising on public walls,
and so on. Near where each Bureaucrat sits is a sign
indicating its function. Point at the Bureaucrat and
<b>TALK</b> to it, phrasing your request or question in one
sentence or less. The Bureaucrat will retreat back into its
box to resume attending to its own affairs. Don&rsquo;t
expect an immediate response: the Bureaucracy is usually
overworked and it may take several days before they can get
around to acting on your case. Don&rsquo;t worry though: you
will be notified through the Habitat mail. Also, like civil
servants everywhere they are very territorial, and each will
refuse to act on any matter that is not in its department
&mdash; so be sure to go to the right one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><small>At first, there was only
the Oracle. Tired of playing solitaire and having the world
all to Itself, the Oracle created Avatars for Its amusement.
All time in Habitat dates from the creation of Avatars, the
Oracle referring to the time before them as

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rule of thumb is,

have a maximum of 10 letters, since your Avatar inherits
your QuantumLink user name. Since you can have up to five

slimewad!&rsquo;&rsquo;</br></br> &lsquo;&lsquo;And why
shouldn&rsquo;t I? As I recall, it was your idea to go in
search of the Jewelled Horn of the Green
Bleem...&rsquo;&rsquo;</br></br> &lsquo;&lsquo;Cosmo,&rsquo;&rsquo;
whispered Dredmitch frantically, &lsquo;&lsquo;stop whining!
Listen! Do you hear that?&rsquo;&rsquo;</br></br> &lsquo;&lsquo;Oh
no,&rsquo;&rsquo; Cosmo moaned, &lsquo;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s
that monster...that disgustingly slimy green</small></i>
<small>thing<i>...and it sounds like it&rsquo;s getting
closer...&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></small></p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ah, adventure &mdash;
The lifeblood of the Avatar. Like many Avatars, you&rsquo;ll
quickly turn amusing yourself into a fine
art.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are, however,
several dos and don&rsquo;ts when it comes to amusement in
Habitat:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big>DOs</big></b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Make new
friends.</i> And lots of them. Avatars love
meeting other Avatars, and consider themselves fortunate in
having a large circle of acquaintances. Just think about
where Cosmo and Dredmitch would be if they hadn&rsquo;t met
each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>TelePorting.</i> Just
the thing that Cosmo and Dredmitch wish they had quick
access to. A TelePort is a lot like a telephone, except
that, instead of sending your voice, you send yourself.
Costs a few more Tokens than walking, but how else can you
travel 3,000 miles in a split second?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Hanging out at the
Oracle.</i> <b>The</b> place to see and be seen. When you
connect into Habitat, you&rsquo;ll want to go down to the
Oracle&rsquo;s fountain to see which of your friends are
hanging out there. And, if no one you know is around,
it&rsquo;s a great opportunity to meet someone
new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Adventures.</i> The
rallying cry of the Avatar. A great way to spend a day...a
week...or longer. Much longer. (Remember old Cosmo and
Dredmitch?) There are several ways to plan an adventure. You
can let the Oracle chart your course, give you clues and
send you on your way. You can keep up with the latest
adventure classified ads in the Habitat newspaper. You can
go it alone, or you can team up with a band of fearless
mercenaries. Or, you could always wait until Cosmo and
Dredmitch get back...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Exploring.</i> Kind of
like adventuring, but without the risk. Habitat is a big
place &mdash; what better way to learn about it than to go
out and explore the surrounding neighborhoods? It&rsquo;s
also a great way to meet other Avatars.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big>DON&rsquo;Ts</big></b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Tennis.</i>
Avatars detest tennis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Television.</i> Nobody
watches it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Card playing.</i>
Playing cards don&rsquo;t exist in Habitat, and repeated
attempts to introduce them have failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Driving vehicles.</i>
Why ride when you can walk or TelePort? The car and
motorcycle as a mode of transportation died out hundreds of
years ago, although you might find the occasional
skateboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Materialism.</i>
Exceeding the Stuff Limit is <i>not</i> the way to impress
your friends. A lot of possessions just overburden you, and
slow you and your friends down. Oh, it&rsquo;s fine to have
little items you can call your own, but don&rsquo;t overdo
it. The average Avatar just isn&rsquo;t impressed by
ostentatious displays of material wealth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>Over-extend your
Avatar&rsquo;s hospitality.</i> Don&rsquo;t forget the
&lsquo;&lsquo;five guests only&rsquo;&rsquo; rule the next
time you decide to hold a hot-tub party.</p>

<center><p style="margin-top: 1em" id="CHAP9"><b>CHAPTER NINE</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big><big>SOME THINGS
WE</big></big></b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b><big><big>JUST DON&rsquo;T
TALK ABOUT...</big></big></b></p></center>

<blockquote><p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;You
know, Filbert,&rsquo;&rsquo; Alendale said quietly,
&lsquo;&lsquo;you could easily buy your way out of this
little...jam...with a few Tokens...say 1000?&rsquo;&rsquo;</br></br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;You know I don&rsquo;t have that kind of
money,&rsquo;&rsquo; Filbert replied, fear in his voice.
&lsquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t afford your protection money. So
go ahead, beat me up.&rsquo;&rsquo;</br></br> &lsquo;&lsquo;You know I
never do the dirty work,&rsquo;&rsquo; Alendale said with an
evil smile. &lsquo;&lsquo;The boys will be by tomorrow
night...unless you can somehow raise the money you owe. And
Filbert,&rsquo;&rsquo; he chuckled,
&lsquo;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t try to hide. We&rsquo;ll find you.
We always do.&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Money. What society
could survive without it? Avatars are lucky...all their
basic financial concerns were taken care of when the
National Leisure Laws were enacted and trust funds, lifetime
trust funds, were established for each one of them.
<i>No</i> Avatar has to work for a
living.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yet, if there&rsquo;s one
thing Avatars don&rsquo;t talk about, it&rsquo;s where they
get the money. The trust funds are an accepted fact, and
it&rsquo;s considered <i>gauche</i> to discuss it. Unless,
of course, you&rsquo;re a petty thief like Alendale.
However, you don&rsquo;t have an infinite supply of cash. At
regular intervals, your bank account will accumulate
interest, which you may spend. You may <i>not</i> spend the
principal. And, interest will accrue as long as you continue
visiting Habitat. So you can never be broke, but you can be
short on cash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Token is the currency
standard in Habitat. Since you can only hold one object in
your hand at one time, a Token object can represent any
amount of cash from one Token to whatever. Pointing at a
Token and pressing the <b>HELP</b> (<b>F7</b>) key will
display its value. You can make change from a Token in your
hand by using the <b>DO</b> command. You will be prompted
for the amount that you would like to keep in your hand; the
balance (if any) will be placed back in your
pocket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can obtain cash from
your bank account by visiting one of the convenient
Automatic Token Machines located throughout Habitat. If you
point at an ATM and select <b>DO</b>, it will tell you your
available bank account balance. Choosing <b>GET</b>
indicates that you wish to withdraw some cash. It will
prompt you for the amount. Just enter the number of Tokens
you want and then press <b>RETURN</b>. You can also deposit
Tokens you are carrying into your bank account by
<b>PUT</b>ing them into the ATM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Throughout Habitat there
are VenDroid machines and other coin-operated devices. A
VenDroid will contain one or more items that you may
purchase. If you are standing next to a VenDroid, pointing
at it and choosing <b>DO</b> will make it display one of the
items you can buy and show you the item&rsquo;s price. To
purchase one of these items, put a Token in the machine (in
other words, point at the VenDroid and select <b>PUT</b>
while your Avatar is holding a Token). The price of the item
will be taken from the Tokens in your Avatar&rsquo;s hand
and your purchase will appear on the ground in front of the
machine. Of course, in order to buy anything from a
VenDroid, you must have enough Tokens in your hand to pay
for it!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There <i>are</i> other
ways to get money. Consider the fortunes of the Avatar
Arnquirt, who went off in search of treasure and came back
with one of the most sacred of Habitat relics &mdash; the
bronze candlestick of Demetrius the Blind. The enterprising
Mr. Arnquirt opened a private museum, drew thousands of
Avatars, and made a small fortune. Which he promptly spent
in his next quest for sunken treasure off the coast of
Andoverland.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tokens also come from
unexpected sources, depending on the Oracle&rsquo;s generous
streak on any given day. The Avatar Jeanette once found a
Token worth T5,000 stuck in a crack in the
sidewalk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avatars also raise quick
cash at the pawn shop &mdash; a seedy if necessary
establishment on the outskirts of most towns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Money&rsquo;s not a
problem, in short, unless you choose to make it a problem.
But then, there&rsquo;s always Alendale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You know how to read,
don&rsquo;t you? In Habitat there are letters, which were
discussed earlier, as well as newspapers and magazines. The
Habitat Rant, the local newspaper, is the best place to look
for the latest news, as well as classified ads about
treasure-hunting expeditions, clues to mysteries, and relics
or valuable items for sale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can submit letters
to the editor and articles for publication to the Rant. Just
write what you have to say on a piece of paper and mail it
to &lsquo;&lsquo;Rant&rsquo;&rsquo;. If the editors like it,
they&rsquo;ll publish it. If they don&rsquo;t like it, they
won&rsquo;t. (The editors are grouchy old curmudgeons. They
reserve the right to do anything they want with your
submission and they don&rsquo;t have to pay for it unless
they feel like it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also mail
classified ads to the Rant. They&rsquo;ll deduct the price
of the ad directly from your bank account. Consult masthead
of the most recent issue for price and format
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the
regular newspapers and magazines, there are also books
published within Habitat. In most towns you&rsquo;ll find a
Public Library containing books full of useful, interesting
or entertaining stuff.</p>
