LAW ENFORCEMENT IN EFFECT BEFORE LAWS???
 Recently we all received H-mail from   
 'CHUYCK' calling for opinions on powers
 for the 'duly elected' sheriff. THE    
 RANT notes that the sheriff election   
 was not open to new avatars and that   
 the voter turnout was so low that the  
 real victor in the election was voter  
 apathy. Before any 'powers' are given: 
 A new election must be held; Duties of 
 the post must be defined; Time between 
 elections must be set; Recall election 
 procedure should be set for "criminal" 
 sheriffs; and laws must be established.

       HABITAT LANDMARK FOR SALE        
                                        
 ORACLE TO PERSONALLY SELECT NEW OWNER  
                                        
   Kelly, proprietor of Kelly's Bar, has
been missing ever since the bar first   
opened its door. The Oracle has declared
Kelly to be in forfiture of the property
due to neglect. The bar will be sold in 
a sealed-bid auction to a qualified buy-
er. Proposals (hours of operation with  
owner present must be included) for run-
ning the Bar should be submitted to the 
appropriate bureaucrat in City Hall. The
'right' buyer will bid time, not tokens.

       BUSINESS BOOM FOR ENTRPRYS       
 Street Fills/Another New Street Planned
                                        
  Sources close to The Oracle recently  
revealed that Entrprys St will be filled
within 2 weeks. The Oracle also plans to
build another new street to meet needs. 
  Zoning reports have leaked information
on plans for one possible new firm. Un- 
named avatars intend to open an inn for 
travelers and for resting after daring  
adventures. It is to be named THE RED   
DRAGON INN. Planners hope to have a     
banquet hall for special events, an ale-
house public room, and rooms to rent.

  YOU'RE THE JURY!!  COURTHOUSE FIRST   
     CASE ABOUT RECOVERY OF AMULET      
                                        
 Come be part of the jury when Habitat's
 new courthouse on Entrprys opens this  
 Saturday, March 5, at 10 pm HST in The 
 Great Amulet Caper Case re-trial. The  
 criminal will be re-tried by Judge CLB,
 who has been appointed by The Oracle to
 replace Judge Themonioli, who failed an
 insanity test. CLB qualified as insane.
 The story of the stolen Amulet Of      
 Wonderous Worth is reprinted (from Rant
 Vol 1, Issue 1) in this issue on the   
 following two pages.

   AMULET BACKGROUND: REPRINT FROM THE  
         RANT VOLUME 1, ISSUE 1         
Today, the thieves in the now famous    
"Great Amulet Caper" were found guilty  
of Grand Theft Magic, and sentenced to 5
years in The Void.  In pronouncing the  
sentence to a hushed, packed courtroom, 
Judge Themonioli was solemn.  "Zap'em   
'til they glow!" he said, "let the      
Oracle sort'em out!  Next case!"        
                                        
The story began last week when the Great
Amulet of Wonderous Worth was stolen    
from the Back-Forty home of Habitat's   
resident Not-So-Wise-Man, Dada Salesh.  
                   7                    

</pre>
<pre>
Salesh, a powerful but clumsy wizard,   
tried to retrieve the valuable trinket  
with a homing-return spell, but his     
attempt backfired.  Instead of          
recovering the stolen property, Salesh  
accidentally Ported the thieves         
themselves to his house.  Although this 
resulted in the thieves' immediate      
capture, the Amulet is still missing.   
                                        
All attempts by officials to extract    
information from the evil-doers have    
been in vain. It is feared that the     
Amulet may remain forever lost.

   SHERIFF POWER: ORACLE ORDERS VOTE    
                                        
 In an untypical display of democracy,  
 The Oracle has ordered a vote to be    
 held on the issue of power for the     
 position of Sheriff. (Related item on  
 Page 3.) Avatars were asked over the   
 past weekend to respond with opinions  
 on what powers should be granted to    
 enforce the "law". There will be a     
 town meeting held on Sunday, 3/6, at   
 4 pm HST to discuss YOUR ideas about   
 Law Enforcement, hosted by Rant        
 Publisher Bahia. Be sure to come and   
 exercise your civil rights!!

 ancients to amuse young avatars. The   
 Oracle announced it will reappear soon.

 calls for a 'read-only' BBS (first come

Wand and wafted all of us home." Greg P 
is against theft; he returned the wand.

    DUNGEON SPAWNS WIZARD'S COUNCIL

                            -Caterwaul- 
  With the current Dungeon adventure    
still going strong, avatars wandering   
streets in Populopolis can expect to    
see magic items around.  These range    
from Twylla Wands that make people jump 
or sit, to powerful Oracle Wands that   
make the user or other avatars suddenly 
appear at the downtown fountain Oracle. 
  Several avatars around town seem to   
have taken up magic as a career move.   
At least one 'wizard' is purchasing the 
                   16

          WIZARDS OR MERCHANTS?         
 Dungeon Quest magic wands for $1500 and
attempting to make large profits through
selling the wands for double the price. 
  With the influx of new magic items,   
there is talk about the formation of a  
Wizard's Council, or some other Magical 
Guild located in a mystical spot in     
Populopolis. True wizards have been     
extremely critical of merchant 'wizards'
who collect windfall profits by preying 
on those who are unaware of the current 
selling price of items in the Dungeon.  
Wizard Dada Salesh stated, "This is bad.
This is bad. This isn't good. Bad. Bad."

  Before brave new Avatars get all      
their equipment out and head for the    
Dungeons, there are many things they    
should know and some things they should 
take with them...                       
  1. Things to carry: A Light of some   
kind, and an Escape Device.  There is   
no need for a Gun at all, as Death and  
Shadows can kill you faster than you    
can shoot them.

2. Beware when DEATH tm and SHADOWS tm  
are around.  Travel Ghosted as much as  
possible and if you aren't ghosted and  
the drive starts spinning, ghost then.  
3. The $ button at Shadow's or Death's  
Turf when pushed will leave 1000$'s on  
the ground.  These can't be taken from  
the dungeon --  you must spend them     
IN the dungeon.  Those of you who feel  
you know your way around the dungeon    
can get a BETTER magic wand if you      
want to risk bringing $okens with you.

4. There is a room with four doors.     
Don't take the last three.  The only    
door that doesn't lead to a Trap from   
there is the first one on the Left.     
5. To get to the Dungeon proper from    
where you enter, go }}} then take the 
door on the Right.  The Left Door leads 
outside and you have to start all over  
again.                                  
6. Recheck all directions, just because 
you came from that direction doesn't    
mean you can get back that way.

7. Don't believe every sign you read.   
Some signs are misleading -- some are   
telling the truth. "Free Maps"..."Don't 
go this way"...it's hard to tell. All we
can say is don't believe everything you 
read.                                   
8. If you cannot afford an Escape Device
carry some poison from Wall Drugs.  It  
might kill you, but at least you won't  
be trapped forever in a barren room.    
9. If you don't have poison or an Escape
Device and get trapped, try using ESP to
get help from a friendly avatar.

 DUNGEON OF DEATH: MORTALITY & MORALITY 
                                        
       ABBOT DEALS WITH SHADOW          
  After several unfortunate events,     
Abbot Greg P came into possession of    
the Shadow's magical staff.  Planning   
to give it back to the infamous Shadow, 
Greg met him at the Oracle.             
  Much to everyone's surprise, Greg     
demanded that before he would give the  
staff back the Shadow must promise that 
"none of the Order's people would be    
harmed in the Dungeon." The Shadow      
refused.

 DUNGEON OF DEATH: MORTALITY & MORALITY 
                                        
  Negotiations continued for almost an  
hour with JeffG2 as mediator until the  
Abbot returned the staff for a promise  
well below what he asked for in the     
beginning. The Shadow promised nothing. 
  When asked to comment on why he gave  
the staff back after the Shadow refused 
to meet any of his demands, Greg        
replied, "The Order does not steal,     
it's wrong."                            
  The Order Of The Holy Walnut admits   
avatars who believe in helping and not  
hurting. Contact Greg P for information.

         COOTIES DISEASE HIGHLY         
                CONTAGIOUS              
                                        
   The Oracle warns of a particularly   
 nasty form of Cooties disease that is  
 is spreading quickly among avatars.    
                                        
   All avatars are advised to be ex-    
 tremely cautious in making contact     
 with others.                           
                                        
   The Oracle also sent a message to be 
 passed on to Rant readers. "So I made  
 diseases. At least I didn't make mos-  
 quitoes. They would have been doozies."

           ADVENTURER'S PAGE            
Most adventures are safer and much more 
pleasant when shared. Creating a team or
a partnership should not be done lightly
Always decide the split on work and on  
rewards BEFORE you start. It is always  
easier to get people to agree on things 
like the split before there is anything 
real to split. A little communication   
can stop a partnership from killing a   
friendship.            -ICwhatUmin-

Q: How was it that you first found the  
  Vault?                                
A: Well err, my friend.. ::Mumble::     
  Raoul::mumble:: showed me where to    
  find it.                              
                                        
Q: How did you find the first Key?      
A: The first safe key I found was       
  actually a joint effort.. Myself and  
  Snickers were down on the beach and

   R&R ADVENTURER MsB OPENS 3 SAFES     
                                        
found a way to get under the water with 
the Fishies.  I had no idea what to do  
with the key.. But our 3rd partner      
Mishka did.. That was where he came     
into the picture.                       
                                        
Q: What all have you found in the Vault?
A: The first safe contained a very      
  powerful homing wand in it.. Which    
  Mishka used to rescue many a lost     
  Avatar in the Dungeon. Until DEATH    
  caught him on one such mission... :(

  Then,  I opened the second safe only  
through the guidance of the Great       
Oracle and discovered another Magical   
Wand.  This one made me walk backwards. 
                                        
The third Safe contained a special head 
which I am wearing now at this moment.
