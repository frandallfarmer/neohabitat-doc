          THE WELCOME CENTER            
                                        
  The Welcome Center is where all new   
  arrivals to Populopolis appear. The   
  Oracle has been known to look         
  favorably upon avatars that hang      
  out here and take newbies under       
  their wing.                           
                                        
  If you are a newbie, please check     
  out the Habitat manual, which you     
  can find here:
