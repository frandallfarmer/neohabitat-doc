Habitat Stock Exchange News! Fall '87 AC
                                        
Populoplis, New Marin-                  
                                        
    All trading of Habitat stocks has   
been suspended because of the infux of  
humans into our world. The oracle has   
pronounced that a NEW method of stock   
& securities exchange will be           
instigated "Whenever I am ready".       
                                        
    Perhaps, with the humans among us,  
the market will be stimulated. I know I 
am already!  &#220;&#220;
