     THINGS TO DO IN HABITAT            
Congratulations!  You're one of the     
Habitat pioneers.  When you get done    
wandering around your Turf, picking     
things up and putting them away again,  
changing the color of your furniture,   
fiddling with the lights, and generally 
learning how things work, you're        
probably going to ask yourself, "So,    
what do I do here?"                     
                                        
A good way to start getting yourself    
oriented is to learn how to use the     
TelePort network.  In order to TelePort 
you'll need cash, so you'll have to find
                   3

a Bank and learn to use the Automatic   
Token Machine.  To find a Bank you'll   
need to find the business district,     
which'll get you out exploring the      
world.  Be sure to take note of your    
street address the first time you step  
out front of your house -- you'll want  
to be able to find your way back!  Visit
the shops downtown.  Head on down to the
Oracle and see who's hanging out.  Be   
friendly!  And keep your eye out for    
clues.  Even though the world is just   
getting started, there's already a few  
adventures awaiting you!

    AMULET OF SALESH STILL MISSING!     
                                        
Today, the thieves in the now famous    
"Great Amulet Caper" were found guilty  
of Grand Theft Magic, and sentenced to 5
years in The Void.  In pronouncing the  
sentence to a hushed, packed courtroom, 
Judge Themonioli was solemn.  "Zap'em   
'til they glow!" he said, "let the      
Oracle sort'em out!  Next case!"        
                                        
The story began last week when the Great
Amulet of Wonderous Worth was stolen    
from the Back-Forty home of Habitat's   
resident Not-So-Wise-Man, Dada Salesh.

Salesh, a powerful but clumsy wizard,   
tried to retrieve the valuable trinket  
with a homing-return spell, but his     
attempt backfired.  Instead of          
recovering the stolen property, Salesh  
accidentally Ported the thieves         
themselves to his house.  Although this 
resulted in the thieves' immediate      
capture, the Amulet is still missing.   
                                        
All attempts by officials to extract    
information from the evil-doers have    
been in vain.  It is feared that the    
Amulet may remain forever lost.
