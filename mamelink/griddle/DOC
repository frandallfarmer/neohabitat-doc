/u0/chip/habitat/griddle:
	This directory contains the Griddle and Fred utilities.  They share
most of their source, since they are mostly the same program, so they are both
together here.  Fred uses Fastlink, so some stuff for it is elsewhere.

These are the files here:
DOC		- This file
regiontools.t	- Documentation for Fred and Griddle

Makefile	- Makefile to compile everything
*.c, *.y, *.h	- Source files

fred		- Executable for Fred
griddle		- Executable for Griddle

reno.out	- Binary for C64 half of Fred (gets uploaded through Fastlink)

util		- A directory containing some minor utilities that work with
		  Fred.  Fred keeps a stat file of what commands are used so
		  We can collect frequency info for improving the command
		  interface.  These utilities deal with this stat file.  The
		  utilities are all short and their source is their
		  documentation.
