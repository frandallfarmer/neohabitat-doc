# Installers
Throughout the life of the project, all of the installation material we collated ended up in this folder. Here is an explanation of what everything is.

### File list

* Habitat_C64.zip - I am unsure what this is, but it was likely an attempt in getting the Terminal enabled client to work on a real C64. Leaving this in for historical purposes or incase we need it in the future.

* Neohabitat.dmg - I am unable to check this out currently, but I presume this is the Mac version of VICE 3.1, pointing to the old NeoHabitat public server at app.neohabitat.org.

* Neohabitat.zip - This is the original directory used for the NeoHabitat Windows setup that was distributed via neohabitat.org prior to the creation of the installer. It should be identical to NeoHabitatInstaller.exe, only it points to app.neohabitat.org instead of habitat.themade.org.

* Neohabitat-RealC64.zip - I am unsure what this is, but it was likely an attempt in getting the Terminal enabled client to work on a real C64. Leaving this in for historical purposes or incase we need it in the future.

* Neohabitat-RealC64SuccessPackage.zip - I am unsure what this is, but it was likely an attempt in getting the Terminal enabled client to work on a real C64. Leaving this in for historical purposes or incase we need it in the future.

* QuantumLink.d64 - This is a clean copy of a Quantum Link client disk. We don't use this for NeoHabitat anymore since we now bypass QLink to login, but leaving this in for historical purposes.

* NeoHabitatInstaller.exe - This is the latest version of the NeoHabitat Windows installer package, containing the x86 3.1 version of the VICE C64 emulator. This has been updates to connect directly to the current NeoHabitat server instance hosted by The MADE over at habitat.themade.org.
